"," adds space
sep ="any symbol"

no increment decrement operator(a++)
a=a+1
a+=0.11
better control

1024%2000 = 1024

shift registers
var=var<<n     *2^n
var=var>>n     /2^n

question double the number without using arithmatic operators
 x=10
 x<<1    (10*2^1)


how to tackle a problem effectively:
1. break it on paper 
	o/p: 
		result/response
	process: 
		how to get o/p
	I/P: 
		to take from user
2. algo / visual

3. code

loop: unit of code repeated n number of times

types of loops: 

1. counter-increment

2. countdown-decrement

loops in python

while- more control and fast, float(can take fractional increment) , no automation , infinite loop

for- slow due to sequence , complete automation , int based 

(no do while loop in python)

in loop we have to decide where to start and where to end

 




''' ........... ''' ->triple single quote is most powerful
if we print only s it will show raw data with escape sequence
and print() will show
